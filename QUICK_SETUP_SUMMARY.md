## 🎯 Next Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Apply Critical Migrations

You need to run at minimum these migrations in Supabase SQL Editor:

```
Batch 1 (Core Tables):
- 20250819181135_db4d2ed6-7b78-4c63-bae4-c4035f0f2496.sql
- 20250820103531_3dbae4a0-6d86-4fb0-afde-aaa13f78e5a7.sql
- 20250820103722_08cf0ea2-a9a7-419d-995f-17fbe3dd5b19.sql

Batch 2 (Fixes):
- Run fix_is_super_admin.sql FIRST
- 20250820134907_7b203c61-5279-465a-8046-836ecfb30607.sql
- 20250820140000_fix_profile_creation_trigger.sql

Batch 3 (Key Features):
- Continue with migrations in order, skipping problematic ones
```

### Step 2: Create Your First User

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/imkdmwsukojuhzjlmyfh/auth/users
2. Click "Add User"
3. Email: your_email@example.com
4. Password: your_strong_password
5. ✅ Check "Auto Confirm User"
6. Click "Create User"

### Step 3: Create Profile in SQL Editor

```sql
-- Replace YOUR-EMAIL with your actual email
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, full_name, email, role, is_active)
SELECT 
  au.id,
  'Administrator',
  au.email,
  'super_admin',
  true
FROM auth.users au
WHERE au.email = 'YOUR-EMAIL'
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE
SET role = 'super_admin',
    is_active = true;
```

### Step 4: Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8080

## 🎨 Logo Setup

Your logo should be at: `/public/lovable-uploads/pett-vision-logo.png`

Currently using: `/public/lovable-uploads/logo-napol.png` (temporary)

## 🔐 Login Credentials

- Email: The one you created in Supabase
- Password: The one you set in Supabase
- No MFA required (disabled for now)

## 📊 What to Test

1. ✅ Login page shows blue theme
2. ✅ Dashboard displays (may be empty initially)
3. ✅ Can navigate to Members page
4. ✅ Can navigate to Loans page
5. ✅ All cards show blue colors (no green visible)

## ⚠️ Note About Migrations

Due to dependency issues, some migrations should be skipped initially:
- Migrations 23-28 (overdue functions) - require loan_payments table that's created later
- Run them after migration 83 (20250827000002_create_loan_payments_table.sql)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Can't login?**
- Check `auth.users` table has your user
- Check `profiles` table has your profile with `role='super_admin'` and `is_active=true`

**Migrations failing?**
- Run the fix scripts first
- Skip problematic migrations and continue
- Come back to fix them later

**System not working?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard
- Verify environment variables are set
