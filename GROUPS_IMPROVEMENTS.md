# Groups System Improvements

## Overview
The Groups page has been redesigned to provide a more user-friendly and efficient experience for loan officers and managers. The new system implements a cascading filter approach and provides easy access to group details and payment recording.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Cascading Filter System
- **Step 1**: Select Meeting Day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- **Step 2**: Select Branch (only shows branches with groups on the selected day)
- **Step 3**: Select Group (only shows groups for the selected day and branch)

This approach eliminates the need to scroll through long lists and makes it easy to find specific groups.

### 2. Group Details Page
- **New Route**: `/groups/:groupId`
- **Features**:
  - Complete group transaction sheet
  - Member management
  - Individual payment recording
  - Bulk payment functionality
  - Export capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Payment Recording
- **Individual Payments**: Click "Record Payment" button for any member to go directly to their loan page
- **Bulk Payments**: Select multiple members and record payments for all at once
- **Navigation**: Easy return to group details after payment recording

### 4. Improved User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear step-by-step process with icons and progress indicators
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to group details with a prominent "View Group Details" button
- **Reduced Friction**: No need to navigate back to groups page and re-filter after each payment

## New Pages Created
