# 🚨 User Deletion Fix - ON CONFLICT Error Resolution

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The user deletion was failing with this error:
```
An error occurred in the delete-user function: Profile deletion failed: Failed to delete user profile after cleanup: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
Error code: 42P10
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause**

The issue was caused by a **database trigger** that fired when deleting user profiles:

1. **Edge function** tries to delete a user profile
2. **Database trigger** `profile_deletion_trigger` fires BEFORE DELETE on profiles table
3. **Trigger function** `handle_profile_deletion()` calls `cleanup_user_references()`
4. **Cleanup function** calls `track_deleted_email()` 
5. **track_deleted_email function** tries to use `ON CONFLICT (original_email)` but the constraint doesn't exist properly

## 🛠️ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Database Constraint Issue**
- Created proper `deleted_email_tracker` table with named unique constraint
- Fixed `ON CONFLICT` clause to reference the correct constraint name
- Added error handling to prevent function failures

### **2. Disabled Problematic Trigger**
- Temporarily disabled `profile_deletion_trigger` that was causing the cascade
- This prevents the automatic cleanup that was failing

### **3. Updated Edge Function**
- Modified the edge function to call cleanup manually
- Added proper error handling for cleanup operations
- Ensured cleanup happens before profile deletion

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### **New Migration Files Created:**
- `20250825000003_fix_deleted_email_tracker_complete.sql` - Complete table fix
- `20250825000004_fix_user_deletion_immediate.sql` - Immediate trigger disable

### **Existing Files Updated:**
- `supabase/migrations/20250825000002_fix_deleted_email_tracker_constraint.sql` - Fixed constraint reference
- `supabase/migrations/20250822280000_fix_user_deletion_constraints.sql` - Fixed ON CONFLICT clause
- `supabase/functions/delete-user/index.ts` - Added manual cleanup call

## 🚀 **How to Apply the Fix**

### **Step 1: Run the Immediate Fix Migration**
```sql
-- Copy and run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- [Contents of 20250825000004_fix_user_deletion_immediate.sql]
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the Updated Edge Function**
```bash
# Deploy the updated delete-user function
supabase functions deploy delete-user
```

### **Step 3: Test User Deletion**
- Try deleting a user through the admin interface
- The deletion should now work without the ON CONFLICT error

## 🔧 **What the Fix Does**

### **Immediate Changes:**
✅ **Disables problematic trigger** - No more automatic cleanup failures
✅ **Fixes table structure** - Proper constraints and indexes
✅ **Adds error handling** - Functions won't crash on errors
✅ **Manual cleanup** - Edge function handles cleanup directly

### **Long-term Benefits:**
✅ **Stable user deletion** - No more constraint errors
✅ **Better error handling** - Graceful degradation on failures
✅ **Maintainable code** - Clear separation of concerns
✅ **Audit trail** - Proper tracking of deleted emails

## 📊 **Database Changes**

### **Tables Created/Modified:**
- `deleted_email_tracker` - Now has proper structure and constraints
- `profiles` - Trigger temporarily disabled

### **Functions Created/Modified:**
- `track_deleted_email()` - Fixed constraint reference
- `cleanup_user_references_simple()` - Simplified cleanup without email tracking
- `can_reuse_email()` - Email reuse checking
- `force_email_reuse()` - Admin email reuse control

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### **Test Case 1: Basic User Deletion**
1. Create a test user
2. Delete the test user
3. Verify no ON CONFLICT errors
4. Check that cleanup happened properly

### **Test Case 2: User with References**
1. Create a user with loan officer assignments
2. Delete the user
3. Verify references are cleaned up
4. Check that loans/members are updated

### **Test Case 3: Error Handling**
1. Try to delete a user with complex references
2. Verify cleanup errors are logged but don't crash
3. Check that profile deletion still succeeds

## 🔮 **Future Improvements**

### **Option 1: Re-enable Trigger (Recommended)**
Once the constraint issues are fully resolved:
```sql
-- Re-create the trigger with proper error handling
CREATE TRIGGER profile_deletion_trigger
  BEFORE DELETE ON profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION handle_profile_deletion_safe();
```

### **Option 2: Keep Manual Cleanup**
- Continue using the edge function for cleanup
- More control over the deletion process
- Better error handling and logging

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Before Applying:**
- **Backup your database** if you have production data
- **Test in development** environment first
- **Check for existing users** that might be affected

### **After Applying:**
- **Monitor user deletions** for any new issues
- **Check cleanup logs** to ensure proper operation
- **Verify email tracking** works for deleted users

## 📞 **Support**

If you encounter any issues after applying this fix:

1. **Check the logs** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Verify migration status** in migrations table
3. **Test with a simple user** first
4. **Contact development team** if problems persist
