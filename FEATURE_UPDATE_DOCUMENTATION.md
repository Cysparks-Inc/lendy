## Technical Implementation Details

### Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Updated UserRole type
export type UserRole = 'super_admin' | 'admin' | 'branch_admin' | 'loan_officer' | 'teller' | 'auditor';

// Updated sidebar configuration
const sidebarConfig: NavGroup[] = [
  // ... existing groups
  {
    label: 'Admin & Notifications',
    requiredRoles: ['super_admin', 'admin'],
    items: [
      { title: 'Notifications', url: '/notifications', icon: Bell },
    ],
  },
];
```

### Payment Processing
```typescript
// Individual payment
const handleIndividualPayment = async () => {
  // Record payment in loan_payments table
  // Update loan balance
  // Update loan status if fully paid
};

// Bulk payment
const handleBulkPayment = async () => {
  // Process multiple payments at once
  // Update all selected loan balances
  // Mark loans as completed if fully paid
};
```

### Member Activation System
```typescript
const handleActivateMember = async () => {
  // Update member status to active
  // Mark activation fee as paid
  // Record activation fee as income
  // Show success notification
};
```

### Filtering Implementation
```typescript
// Enhanced filtering with multiple criteria
const filteredData = data.filter(item => {
  const searchMatch = item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase());
  const statusMatch = statusFilter === 'all' || item.status === statusFilter;
  const branchMatch = branchFilter === 'all' || item.branch.includes(branchFilter);
  const officerMatch = officerFilter === 'all' || item.officer.includes(officerFilter);
  return searchMatch && statusMatch && branchMatch && officerMatch;
});
```
